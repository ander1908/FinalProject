# FinalProject
Final Project 3
This was the final project for the Northwestern Bootcamp. Due to scheduling and outside conflicts this is my individual effort for the final proejct. After working through a few Ideas, this production is fairly simple. The goal is to seperate the win and loss data from a season of team statistics, clean the remaining data for pertinent and non-redundant stats, and then apply a machine learning algorithm to the remaining data to create a prediction of playoff success. 

With this in place I created a simple flask app to interact with a webpage hosted on heroku. A user is able to input their team name, and their results are generated for their use.
